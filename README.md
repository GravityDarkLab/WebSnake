This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Game Rules

1. The player controls a square (the snake), which can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
2. A piece of food appears randomly on the grid.
3. The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its length grows by one unit, and the player's score increases.
4. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with its own body.

## Features

- The game features a scoring system. Each piece of food eaten increases the score by one point.
- The game speed increases each time the snake eats a piece of food, making the game progressively more difficult.
- The game can be restarted at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Implementation

The game is implemented using JavaScript for the game logic, HTML for the game structure, and CSS for the game styling.

- The JavaScript code controls the game logic (such as the snake's movement, collision detection, and food consumption) and updates the HTML elements on the page.
- The game uses an object-oriented approach to organize the game configuration and state, making the code easier to read and maintain.

## How to Play

1. Access the game directly through [this link](https://gravitydarklab.github.io/WebSnake/).
2. Alternatively, you can clone the repository or download the files to your local machine and open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and eat the food.
